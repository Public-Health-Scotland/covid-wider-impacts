"After a child receives a review, it takes time for a record of the review to be entered into the CHSP-PS system. We have allowed a 6 week window for data entry.

Although the vast majority of data on reviews given will be recorded within 6 weeks, data shown for the most recent cohorts of children will not be fully complete in CHSP-PS at this stage.", br(), 
"Data is shown for Scotland and for NHS Board areas. Due to small numbers of children in the Island Boards, results for NHS Orkney, NHS Shetland, and NHS Western Isles are not shown separately, however the Island Boards are included within the Scotland total. NHS Grampian has had difficulty recording reviews given on the CHSP-PS system since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic. Information on children in Grampian has therefore been excluded, and Grampian is not included in the Scotland totals. We hope to include NHS Grampian in future releases once local data recording difficulties are resolved.", br(),
"Coverage rates based on small numbers are prone to fluctuation. Therefore, in Boards with small numbers of children eligible for review each week, particularly NHS Borders and NHS Dumfries & Galloway, it is important to consider this when interpreting the rates.
