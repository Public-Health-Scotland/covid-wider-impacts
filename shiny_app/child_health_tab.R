The charts show the progression of uptake of the relevant vaccine as children age.  The data tables provide the uptake rates at two time-points in the chart.  Firstly, the uptake rate reached by a fixed age is shown.  For example, for the first dose of the 6-in-1 vaccine which is offered at the 8 week appointment, uptake by the time children turn 12 weeks old is shown.  Secondly, the overall uptake rate recorded by the date the data was extracted from SIRS for analysis is shown.",br(),

Data is also shown for children who became eligible for vaccination before the pandemic (in 2019 and in January and February 2020) for comparison. After a child receives a vaccination, it can take some time for the record of the vaccination to be returned to the NHS Board child health department and entered into the SIRS system.  We have allowed a 6 week window for data entry.  So, for the first release of this page on 3 June 2020, information was extracted from SIRS on 25 May, and results were reported for children becoming eligible for vaccination up to 6 weeks previously,
                      i.e. up to the week beginning 6 April.  Although the vast majority of data on vaccinations given will be recorded within 6 weeks, data shown for the most recent cohorts of children will not be fully complete in SIRS at this stage.",br(),

Due to small numbers of children in the Island Boards, results for NHS Orkney, NHS Shetland, and NHS Western Isles are not shown separately, however the Island Boards are included within the Scotland total.  Aberdeenshire local authority area within NHS Grampian has had difficulty recording vaccinations given on the SIRS system since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic.  Information on children in Aberdeenshire has therefore been excluded from figures provided for NHS Grampian and Scotland as a whole.  We hope to include Aberdeenshire in future releases once local data recording difficulties are resolved.")
