In September the rate of stillbirths, neonatal deaths and extended perinatal deaths remained within control limits. Post-neonatal deaths are those which occur after 4 weeks of age, but within the first year of life. In September the rate of post-neonatal deaths was 2.2 per 1,000 live births. This is above the warning limit of 2.1 per 1,000, but below the control limit of 2.6 per 1,000. These thresholds are shown on the control charts, and are used to help differentiate between expected random variation and substantial changes which warrant further investigation. The overall infant mortality rate, which includes all deaths of children aged under 1 year (both below and above 4 weeks of age), remained within the warning limit. This pattern suggests that the higher rate of post-neonatal deaths in September reflects random variation in what is a tragic, but fortunately rare event. 
Monthly monitoring of these data will continue.
