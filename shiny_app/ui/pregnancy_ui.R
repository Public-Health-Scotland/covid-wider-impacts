      in a timely way both the direct impact of COVID-19 on pregnant women, and the wider impacts of 
      changes to maternity services and how women interact with services.  The data return is based 
      on an extract of data recorded by midwives in local clinical information systems.  The information 
      relates to the first main appointment a woman has with her maternity service: as noted above, 
      during COVID-19 this will have changed from an in-person to a remote consultation in many areas."),

      of women booking just before and just after the holidays. The number of women booking then returned 
      to previous levels until mid-May 2020.  From mid-May to end September (the latest point for which 
      data is currently available), the number of women booking has been consistently lower than expected 
      based on previous average levels.  Over the 19 weeks from week beginning 18 May 2020 to week

      pre-pandemic levels have booked for antenatal care in Scotland.  As women most commonly book at 
      around 9 weeks gestation, women booking from mid-May onwards will broadly reflect women getting 
      pregnant from late March 2020 onwards, i.e. the point at which the initial UK wide lockdown was 
      implemented in response to COVID-19."),

      through this tool (see the Commentary on Terminations of pregnancy for more information). Considering 
      both sets of data, it seems likely that both reasons apply. It is likely that the higher than usual 
      number of terminations of pregnancy provided in March and April 2020 at least partially contributed 
      to the initial fall in the number of women booking for antenatal care from mid-May. Conversely, 
      the subsequent sustained reduction seen in both the number of terminations and the number of women 
      booking for antenatal care is likely to reflect a reduction in the number of women becoming pregnant 
      from April 2020 onwards. Further analysis is required to accurately examine trends in the number 
      of women becoming pregnant during the COVID-19 pandemic, their subsequent choices to continue with 
      or terminate their pregnancy, and what this means for future trends in the number of births in Scotland."),

      antenatal care was around 9 and a half weeks of pregnancy.  This fell slightly from the end 
      of March 2020, reaching around 8 and a half weeks by end June 2020 before increasing back 
      to previous levels from August 2020 onwards. This temporary reduction in the average gestation 
      at booking means that the recent fall seen in the number of women booking is unlikely to be 
      due to women deferring, or being unable to access, booking until later in their pregnancy. 
      This further confirms that it is likely that the number of women becoming pregnant has been 
      lower than usual from April 2020 onwards."),
